The following CSS code snippet has an unusual error that may not immediately be apparent:  .box { width: 100%; height: 100%; } .container { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; } This CSS intends to create a box that fills the viewport, and a container that centers the box within it. However, if the height of the container is not explicitly set, or is set to a value other than 100%, the box might not center correctly, despite the flexbox properties. The problem originates from the interaction between percentage height values and the flexible box layout. The height of a flex container depends on its content unless it has a defined height, and it is a common issue that beginners often encounter.
